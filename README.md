# Whatsapp-Number-Filter
WhatsApp Number Filter is a cross-platform CLI tool that uses Selenium to automate WhatsApp Web and check which phone numbers are registered. It reads numbers from a file, opens each in the browser, and automatically saves valid and invalid numbers to separate output files for easy filtering.
